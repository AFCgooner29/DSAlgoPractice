/*
 * Remove Extra Edge

 



 


Problem Description


Given a binary tree A where all values of nodes are distinct, there is a pair of leaf nodes which have the same value.

 

 

 

Considering that the pair that has the same value is indeed the same node and not two different nodes, return the tree after removing one of the edges from it.

You need to remove the edge from the parent whose value is greater. See examples for more details.

 

 

 



Problem Constraints


1 <= size of tree <= 100000

 

 

 

1 <= value of node <= 109

 

 

 



Input Format


First and only argument is the binary tree A.



Output Format


Return the root of the binary tree after removing the extra edge.
