 * If we observe bits from rightmost side at distance i than bits get inverted after 2i position in vertical sequence.

For example A = 5;
0 = 0000
1 = 0001
2 = 0010
3 = 0011
4 = 0100
5 = 0101

Observe the right most bit (i = 0) the bits get flipped after (20 = 1)
Observe the 3rd rightmost bit (i = 2) the bits get flipped after (22 = 4)

So, We can count bits in vertical fashion such that at i’th right most position bits will be get flipped after 2i iteration;
